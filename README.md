# ESP-Rider_Tracked_Vehicle

Cellphone control using a L9110S moto driver software for a tracked, crawler type vehicle.

Uses an ESP32 Dev kit module to control a small tracked vehicles direction and speed with a L9110S H-bridge.

The code uses PWM and channels.

This will set up a local wifi connection to the car which will allow a user to access the car's control html page.

Esp32 must be set up in preferences in Arduino IDE. https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/
